Empower your AI apps with clean data from any repository. Featuring advanced codebase file-trees, semantic search, llms.txt and data extraction capabilities.


## What is Codecrawl?

[Codecrawl](https://crawl.irere.dev?ref=github) is an API service that takes a repository URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data, generate embeddings then store them in a vector database. We currently support only public codebases accessible on different codehosts like GitHub and Gitlab and give you clean data for each.

## How to use it?

We will provide an easy to use API with our hosted version. You can find the playground and documentation [here](https://crawl.irere.dev/playground). You can also self host the backend if you'd like.

Check out the following resources to get started:
- [x] **API**: [Documentation](#cooming-soon)
- [x] **SDKs**: [Node](https://github.com/Idee8/codecrawl/blob/main/packages/sdk)
- [ ] Want an SDK or Integration? Let us know by opening an issue.

To run locally, refer to guide [here](https://github.com/Idee8/codecrawl/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### API Key

To use the API, you need to sign up on [Codecrawl](https://crawl.irere.dev) and get an API key.

### Features

- [**File Structure**](#filetree): Get repository file structure to feed to LLMs.
- [**LLMs.txt**](#llms.txt): Generate a Llms.txt to feed directly to any model
- [**Extract**](#indexing): Get structured data from single repo, multiple repo with the help AI.
- [**Search**](#search): Search repository content with semantic understanding
- [**Batch**](#batch-indexing-multiple-urls): Process multiple repositories simultaneously

### Powerful Capabilities
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Convert repository content to markdown, XML, plain text
- **Structured Data**: Extract metadata like file stats, token counts, and repository info
- **Advanced Search**: Find relevant files and content with semantic search
- **Repository Analytics**: Get insights on file sizes, token counts and top files
- **Scalable Processing**: Handle large codebases with configurable limits and batch operations
- **Clean Data**: Remove comments, empty lines and get compressed output as needed


### LLMs.txt

Generate a `llms.txt` file for a repository, optimized for feeding Language Model training. This endpoint initiates a job to create the `llms.txt` file and returns a job ID to track its progress.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.irere.dev/v1/llmstxt \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://github.com/irere123/run-lang"
  }'
```

Returns a job ID to check the status of the `llms.txt` generation.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "123-456-789"
}
```

### Check LLMs.txt Job

Check the status and retrieve the content of a `llms.txt` generation job using the job ID.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.irere.dev/v1/llmstxt/123-456-789 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Returns the status and data of the `llms.txt` generation job.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "completed",
  "data": {
    "llmstxt": "Content of the llms.txt file..."
  }
}
```

### Generate FileTree

Used to get the file tree of the whole repository using its URL. This returns plain tree for given repository. 
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.irere.dev/v1/tree \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://github.com/irere123/run-lang", 
    }'
```

### Check FileTree Job

Check the status and retrieve the content of a `/v1/tree` generation job using the job ID.

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.irere.dev/v1/tree/123-456-789 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Returns the status and data of the `/v1/tree` generation job.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "completed",
  "data": {
    "tree": "Repository filetree..."
  }
}
```
